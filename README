This module is designed to parse through a directory
of csv files containing transaction information for "Square" card reader transactions.

The files contain the following details, each in a different cell in one row:
- user_id: Username for the merchant using Squares card reader
- payment_id: Unique ID code for that individual transaction
- payment_amount: Amount processed
- card_present: Was the card present. Data contains a "TRUE" if it was, empty if not.
  if customer used their account with that merchant to pay instead of their
  credit card.
- created_at: Date of transaction

There is one transaction per row.
A sample row would contain five cells, here are some sample values:

benjohnston1985, f394fn93, 13.99, TRUE, 05/11/2011

Percentile information. I used the following paper for determining a percentile
